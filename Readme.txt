TRAKE Eye Design Test Harness, October 2020

These directories should contain everything you need to reproduce the results given in the paper "As Plain as the Nose on you Face?", except for OpenCV itself and a C++ compiler.

You may have to edit a few things to match your own directory structure.
The cryptic directory names I used when developing the test harness are not the same as the more meaningful names which I used when creating this archive.

Everything is my own work (the copyright is mine, but commercialisation rights are owned by the University of Malta) except where noted otherwise.

1. Code

You will have to edit the file "FileLocations.hpp" to match wherever it is that you have chosen to store the files, and compile and link the program.

2. Labels

Should be OK as they are.

3. Cascades

Some of these cascades come with OpenCV. The dates on the files are January 2015.
They include copyright notices dated 2000, according to which they were developed by Intel.

Some of these cascade were produced by Castrillon for his 2007 paper. The dates on the files are when I downloaded them.
They include Castrillon's copyright notice dated 2008.

The remainder are my own work, issued under the MIT Licence and dated October 2020.

4. Image Files

These are selections of files from "Labelled Faces in the Wild". If you want to read their copyright notice, go to their web site.
